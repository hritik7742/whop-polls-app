# Headers Fix - Multi-User Voting Solution

## Problem Identified
The issue was that manual headers were being passed from the frontend to the API, but these headers didn't include the proper authentication cookies that Whop needs for user identification.

## Root Cause
In `experience-view.tsx`, the `handleVote` function was manually passing headers:
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
const response = await fetch(`/api/polls/${pollId}/vote`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    ...headers, // ‚ùå Manual headers don't include auth cookies
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ option_id: optionId }),
});
```

## The Fix
Removed manual headers and let the browser handle authentication automatically:

```typescript
// AFTER (CORRECT)
const response = await fetch(`/api/polls/${pollId}/vote`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    // ‚úÖ No manual headers - let browser send cookies automatically
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ option_id: optionId }),
  credentials: 'include', // ‚úÖ Ensure cookies are sent
});
```

## Why This Works

1. **Whop SDK uses cookies for authentication** - not manual headers
2. **Browser automatically sends cookies** when making requests to the same domain
3. **`credentials: 'include'`** ensures cookies are included in the request
4. **`verifyUserToken(request.headers)`** in the API route automatically reads the authentication cookie

## Files Modified

### `whop-app/app/experiences/[experienceId]/experience-view.tsx`
- Removed `...headers` from fetch request
- Added `credentials: 'include'` to ensure cookies are sent
- Added comment explaining the change

## Expected Results

After this fix:
- ‚úÖ **Different users will get different user IDs** when authenticating
- ‚úÖ **Each user's vote will be saved** with their unique user ID
- ‚úÖ **Database will show multiple users** in the poll_votes table
- ‚úÖ **Vote counts will be accurate** for all users

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the changes**
2. **Test with different users**:
   - Open app in incognito window
   - Login with different user account
   - Vote on a poll
3. **Check the logs** for different user IDs:
   - `üîê User authenticated successfully: [different-user-id]`
   - `üó≥Ô∏è About to save vote: { userId: '[different-user-id]' }`
4. **Check the database** - should see votes from multiple users

## Debug Endpoints

If you want to verify the fix is working, use these debug endpoints:
- `/api/debug/auth` - Check user authentication
- `/api/debug/database` - Check database state
- `/api/debug/sdk-config` - Check SDK configuration

## Key Insight

The key insight was that **Whop's authentication is cookie-based, not header-based**. When you manually pass headers, you're not including the authentication cookies that Whop needs to identify different users. By letting the browser handle cookies automatically, each user's authentication is properly maintained.

This is a common mistake when working with cookie-based authentication systems - you don't need to manually pass authentication data, the browser handles it automatically.
