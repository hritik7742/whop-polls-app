# Multi-User Voting System Fix

## Problem Identified

The voting system was only saving votes for one user (the app owner/agent user) instead of all users who voted. This was caused by incorrect Whop SDK configuration.

## Root Cause

The Whop SDK was configured with a fixed `onBehalfOfUserId` and `companyId` from environment variables, which meant:

1. **All API requests were made on behalf of the agent user** instead of the actual voting user
2. **User authentication was not properly handled** for different users
3. **Access checks were performed for the wrong user context**

## Files Modified

### 1. `whop-app/lib/whop-sdk.ts`
**Problem**: SDK was configured with fixed `onBehalfOfUserId` and `companyId`
**Fix**: Removed fixed user/company context to allow proper user authentication per request

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
whopSdkInstance = WhopServerSdk({
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID!,
  appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY!,
  onBehalfOfUserId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID, // ‚ùå Fixed user
  companyId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID, // ‚ùå Fixed company
});

// AFTER (CORRECT)
whopSdkInstance = WhopServerSdk({
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID!,
  appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY!,
  // ‚úÖ No fixed user/company - determined per request
});
```

### 2. `whop-app/app/api/polls/[pollId]/vote/route.ts`
**Problem**: Access checks were not using the correct user context
**Fix**: Added proper user context and enhanced logging

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
const accessResult = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
  userId,
  experienceId: poll.experience_id,
});

// AFTER (CORRECT)
const userSdk = whopSdk.withUser(userId); // ‚úÖ Use specific user context
const accessResult = await userSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
  userId,
  experienceId: poll.experience_id,
});
```

### 3. `whop-app/lib/db/polls.ts`
**Problem**: No logging to track voting operations
**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging to track user votes

```typescript
// Added logging throughout the voting process
console.log('üó≥Ô∏è voteOnPoll called:', { pollId, optionId, userId });
console.log('‚ûï User voting for the first time, inserting new vote');
console.log('‚úÖ Vote inserted successfully');
```

### 4. `whop-app/app/api/polls/route.ts`
**Problem**: Poll creation also had incorrect user context
**Fix**: Applied same user context fix for consistency

### 5. `whop-app/app/api/user/subscription/route.ts`
**Problem**: User subscription API also had incorrect user context
**Fix**: Added logging and ensured proper user authentication

## How the Fix Works

### 1. **Proper User Authentication**
- Each API request now properly authenticates the actual user making the request
- The `verifyUserToken` function returns the correct user ID for each request
- No more fixed agent user context interfering with user operations

### 2. **Correct Access Verification**
- Access checks are now performed for the actual user, not the agent user
- Uses `whopSdk.withUser(userId)` to create user-specific SDK instances
- Properly verifies if the actual user has access to vote on polls

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the voting process
- Tracks user authentication, access checks, and vote operations
- Makes it easy to debug any remaining issues

### 4. **Database Operations**
- Vote insertion now uses the correct user ID from authentication
- Each user's vote is properly stored in the `poll_votes` table
- Vote counts are correctly updated for each user's vote

## Testing the Fix

### 1. **Run the Database Test Script**
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of whop-app/lib/db/test-multi-user-voting.sql
-- This will show you the current state of votes in your database
```

### 2. **Test with Multiple Users**
1. Create a poll with multiple options
2. Have different users vote on the poll
3. Check the database to verify all votes are saved
4. Verify vote counts are accurate in the dashboard

### 3. **Check the Logs**
Look for these log messages in your application logs:
- `üîê User authenticated: [user-id]`
- `üîç Experience access check: [result]`
- `üó≥Ô∏è voteOnPoll called: [details]`
- `‚úÖ Vote inserted successfully`

## Expected Results After Fix

### ‚úÖ **All Users Can Vote**
- Every user who votes will have their vote saved to the database
- Each user gets their own row in the `poll_votes` table
- No more "only one user's votes are saved" issue

### ‚úÖ **Accurate Vote Counts**
- Vote counts in `poll_options` table match actual votes
- Dashboard shows correct vote totals for all users
- Real-time updates work for all users

### ‚úÖ **Proper Access Control**
- Users can only vote on polls they have access to
- Access checks are performed for the correct user
- No unauthorized voting

### ‚úÖ **Database Consistency**
- No duplicate votes per user per poll (enforced by unique constraint)
- Vote counts are automatically maintained
- All voting operations are properly logged

## Monitoring

After deploying the fix, monitor:

1. **Database Vote Counts**: Run the test script regularly to check for inconsistencies
2. **Application Logs**: Look for authentication and voting success messages
3. **User Feedback**: Ensure users can vote and see their votes reflected
4. **Dashboard Accuracy**: Verify vote counts match actual user votes

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can temporarily rollback by:

1. Reverting the Whop SDK configuration to use fixed user context
2. However, this will bring back the original problem
3. Better to debug and fix any remaining issues

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- No database schema changes were required
- All existing votes remain intact
- The fix applies to all voting operations (new votes, vote changes, etc.)

This fix ensures that your polling app works correctly for all users, not just the app owner.
