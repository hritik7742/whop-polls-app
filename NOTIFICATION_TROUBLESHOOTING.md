# Push Notification Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status

Based on your terminal logs, the notification system is working correctly from a technical standpoint:

```
âœ… Poll notification sent for poll cc36c59f-3c46-45cb-aff6-055a841d6275 to all users in experience biz_YX2FRzxxEDS7oz
Notification result: null
```

The notification is being sent successfully, but `result: null` suggests a potential issue with user targeting or Whop configuration.

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### 1. **No Users in Experience**
**Issue**: The experience might not have any users to notify.

**Check**: 
- Verify users have access to the experience
- Check if users are properly added to the experience in Whop dashboard

**Solution**: Add test users to the experience in your Whop dashboard.

### 2. **Whop App Configuration**
**Issue**: The Whop app might not be properly configured for notifications.

**Check**:
- Verify your Whop app has notification permissions
- Check if the app is properly installed in the experience
- Ensure the app is active and not in development mode

**Solution**: 
1. Go to your Whop dashboard
2. Check app permissions
3. Verify the app is installed in the experience
4. Test with a simple notification first

### 3. **User Notification Settings**
**Issue**: Users might have disabled notifications for the app.

**Check**:
- Users' device notification settings
- Whop app notification permissions
- Browser notification permissions (if using web)

**Solution**: Ask users to check their notification settings.

### 4. **Experience ID Issues**
**Issue**: The experience ID might be incorrect or the experience might not exist.

**Check**:
- Verify `biz_YX2FRzxxEDS7oz` is a valid experience ID
- Check if the experience is active
- Verify the experience has users

**Solution**: Test with a different experience ID or create a new test experience.

### 5. **Whop SDK Configuration**
**Issue**: The Whop SDK might not be properly configured.

**Check**:
- Environment variables are set correctly
- App ID and API key are valid
- SDK is properly initialized

**Solution**: Verify all environment variables in `.env.local`.

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test with Simple Notification
Create a simple test notification to verify the basic functionality:

```javascript
await whopSdk.notifications.sendPushNotification({
  title: "Test Notification",
  content: "This is a test notification",
  experienceId: "biz_YX2FRzxxEDS7oz",
  isMention: true
});
```

### Step 2: Check Whop Dashboard
1. Go to your Whop dashboard
2. Navigate to the experience
3. Check if users are properly added
4. Verify the app is installed and active

### Step 3: Test with Different Experience
Try creating a poll in a different experience to see if the issue is experience-specific.

### Step 4: Check User Devices
1. Ask users to check their notification settings
2. Verify they have the Whop app installed
3. Check if notifications are enabled for the app

## Debug Information

### Current Notification Payload
```json
{
  "title": "New Poll Available!",
  "content": "what is your fav color",
  "subtitle": "Community Poll",
  "experienceId": "biz_YX2FRzxxEDS7oz",
  "externalId": "cc36c59f-3c46-45cb-aff6-055a841d6275",
  "isMention": true,
  "restPath": "polls/cc36c59f-3c46-45cb-aff6-055a841d6275",
  "senderUserId": "user_YsPkGs1l1SAro"
}
```

### Expected Behavior
1. All users in experience `biz_YX2FRzxxEDS7oz` should receive push notification
2. Notification should appear on their devices
3. Tapping should open the poll

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Experience Users**: Check if there are users in the experience
2. **Test Simple Notification**: Try a basic notification first
3. **Check Whop Dashboard**: Verify app configuration
4. **Test Different Experience**: Try with another experience
5. **Contact Whop Support**: If all else fails, contact Whop support

## Common Solutions

### Solution 1: Add Test Users
1. Go to Whop dashboard
2. Add test users to the experience
3. Create a poll and test notifications

### Solution 2: Check App Permissions
1. Verify app has notification permissions
2. Check if app is properly installed
3. Ensure app is active

### Solution 3: Test with Different Parameters
Try different notification parameters to isolate the issue:

```javascript
// Test 1: Minimal notification
await whopSdk.notifications.sendPushNotification({
  title: "Test",
  content: "Test",
  experienceId: "biz_YX2FRzxxEDS7oz"
});

// Test 2: With mention
await whopSdk.notifications.sendPushNotification({
  title: "Test",
  content: "Test",
  experienceId: "biz_YX2FRzxxEDS7oz",
  isMention: true
});
```

The notification system is technically working - the issue is likely with user targeting or Whop configuration.
